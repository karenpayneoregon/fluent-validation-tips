# About

This project is to demonstrate the basics for working with SQL-Server database data using Microsoft EF Core which is the flagship for working with data from any major database.

- All containers and configurations for interacting with data were done using a free extension to Visual Studio known as [EF Power Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ErikEJ.EFCorePowerTools).
