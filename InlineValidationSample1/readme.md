# About

An example for using an FluentValidation [inline validation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/blob/main/src/FluentValidation/InlineValidator.cs) which is not documented.

## What is inline validation?

Placing property rules directly in the class itself. This is useful when the validation rules are simple and you don't want to create a separate class for them or experimenting with creating rules.

## Usage

No different from conventional usage in Window Forms, Console and ASP.NET Core.

Code was done in Windows Forms as its easy to visualize what is happening.
